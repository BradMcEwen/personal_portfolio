                <h1 class="first">My Background</h1>
                <p class="contents">I am a 26 years old man and from upstate New York. Who I am today was shaped by obstacles that I had to deal with at a young-ish age.
                     I am genuinely thankful for everything I have experienced in life because it has given me my dedicated and hardworking attitude.
                     For a lot of my upbringing I used gaming and my computer as a distraction and it made me love technology. That is ultimately why I am here today!

                <h1 class="first">My education</h1>
                <p class="contents">I have received my education through the full-time full-stack "Coding-Temple" boot camp. Through this camp, 
                    I have been introduced to numerous coding languages/frameworks in front-end and back-end engineering!</p>

                <h1 class="first">My Goals</h1>
                <p class="contents">My goals in this field are very simple. I want to become fluent in as many languages and frameworks as I possibly can. 
                    I enjoy learning and have never felt so satisfied accomplishing a feat in any other learning experience in my life.
                    My goal is to become a perfect full-stack developer that can accomplish any task thrown my way.</p>

                <h1 class="first">My Interests</h1>
                <p class="contents">As you can probably guess, I enjoy gaming a good amount. I have been gaming since I was a toddler.
                    I also enjoy basketball and hiking as my "get out of the house" activities.
