# Personal Portfolio Project #

**This project was my first take on building a personal portfolio!**

## directory ##
 
We start off with a nav bar on the top of the screen with links to each page of my portfolio, including: Home, About, Resume, Contact.
My "logo" also brings the user back to the home page from any page as well.

The home page is very basic that needs some work/ extra content. It does include a picture of me with a brief bio and links to contacting me.
At the bottom of the page I put links to my github/linkedin profiles.

The about page goes more into detail of who I am and who I want to become in this career.

My resume shows my experiences and education in this field along with my skills in frameworks/languages and how comfortable I am in those specific skills.

The contact page has a big text box for contacts to fill out and send to me including their name, email, phone number and a specific message.

All links in this project take you where you expect to go flawlessly.

This project is still under construction. The contact page needs to be worked on. The main page will get more content soon. Project page coming soon!
